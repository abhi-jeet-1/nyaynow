## The Problem

Every day, millions of Indians face legal situations they're not prepared for — a traffic challan they don't deserve, a road accident with no idea what to do, a police encounter that feels wrong, or an online scam they just fell for. Most people don't have a lawyer's number saved. And even if they do, getting timely help is nearly impossible.

## The Solution

NyayNow is an on-demand legal services platform. Open the app, pick your issue, and get connected to a qualified lawyer near you within minutes — via voice or video call.
